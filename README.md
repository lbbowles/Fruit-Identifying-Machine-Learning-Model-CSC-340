This was my final submission for CSC 410.  The entire class was focused on Machine Learning models so that is the focus of this project as well.  That being said, 
actually running the program is definitely the right way to digest this - that or going to look at the LaTex PDF that explains the logic and shows the results.  To actually run 
this code I would recommend utilization of the Spyder IDE due to it being able to easily load the corresponding graphs on the right hand side of the screen - I am aware of a few 
other IDE's that would also achieve this, I am just partial to Spyder.  Once it is downloaded, you would simply take the input fruit file and drag it to the desktop screen, once 
there, the program can find the input fruits and feed the information to you.  Make sure to create the corresponding output file to see the CSVs and not just the data in the 
printscreen.
